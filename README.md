(Updated to bitcoin 0.20 and ubuntu 20.04)

Create your own private bitcoin testnet

You must have `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-cli` installed on your system and in the
path unless running this within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container
(see [below](#using-with-docker)).

## Large Git History
If you'd like to clone this git repository locally and disk space or bandwidth
usage is of concern, it's suggested to do a shallow clone, excluding some
earlier history of the repo, where some testnet data was included.

> Regular clone: `du -sh .` 44M

> Shallow clone: `du -sh .` 168K

### Regular Clone
```
git clone git@github.com:nan0desu/bitcoin-testnet-box.git
```

### Shallow Clone
```
git clone --shallow-since 2014-10-18 git@github.com:nan0desu/bitcoin-testnet-box.git
```

## Starting the testnet-box

This will start up two nodes using the two datadirs `1` and `2`. They
will only connect to each other in order to remain an isolated private testnet.
Two nodes are provided, as one is used to generate blocks and it's balance
will be increased as this occurs (imitating a miner). You may want a second node
where this behavior is not observed.

Node `1` will listen on port `19000`, allowing node `2` to connect to it.

Node `1` will listen on port `19001` and node `2` will listen on port `19011`
for the JSON-RPC server.


```
$ make start
```

## Check the status of the nodes

```
$ make getinfo
bitcoin-cli -datadir=1  -getinfo
{
  "version": 200000,
  "blocks": 0,
  "headers": 0,
  "verificationprogress": 1,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "connections": 1,
  "proxy": "",
  "difficulty": 4.656542373906925e-10,
  "chain": "regtest",
  "balance": 0.00000000,
  "keypoolsize": 1000,
  "paytxfee": 0.00000000,
  "relayfee": 0.00001000,
  "warnings": ""
}
bitcoin-cli -datadir=2  -getinfo
{
  "version": 200000,
  "blocks": 0,
  "headers": 0,
  "verificationprogress": 1,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "connections": 1,
  "proxy": "",
  "difficulty": 4.656542373906925e-10,
  "chain": "regtest",
  "balance": 0.00000000,
  "keypoolsize": 1000,
  "paytxfee": 0.00000000,
  "relayfee": 0.00001000,
  "warnings": ""
}
```
## Creating wallets

```
bitcoin-cli -datadir=1 createwallet wallet1
```

```
bitcoin-cli -datadir=2 createwallet wallet2
```

## Generate a wallet address for the first wallet
```
$ make address1
```

## Generating blocks

Normally on the live, real, bitcoin network, blocks are generated, on average,
every 10 minutes. Since this testnet-in-box uses Bitcoin Core's (bitcoind)
regtest mode, we are able to generate a block on a private network
instantly using a simple command.

To generate a block: (be sure to change the ADDRESS value below to wallet address generated in the prior command)

```
$ make generate ADDRESS=[bitcoin address]
```

To generate more than 1 block:

```
$ make generate BLOCKS=10 ADDRESS=[bitcoin address]
```

## Need to generate at least 100 blocks before there will be a balance in the first wallet
```
$ make generate BLOCKS=200 ADDRESS=[bitcoin address]
```

## Verify that there is a balance on the first wallet
```
$ make getinfo
```

## Generate a wallet address for the second wallet
```
$ make address2
```

## Sending bitcoins
To send bitcoins that you've generated to the second wallet: 

```
$ make sendfrom1 ADDRESS=[bitcoin address] AMOUNT=10
```

## Does the balance show up?
Run the getinfo command again. Does the balance show up? Why not?
```
$ make getinfo
```

## Generate another block
```
$ make generate ADDRESS=[bitcoin address]
```

## Stopping the testnet-box

```
$ make stop
```

To clean up any files created while running the testnet and restore to the
original state:

```
$ make clean
```

## Using with docker
This testnet-box can be used with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run it in
an isolated container.

### Building docker image

Pull the image
  * `docker pull nan0desu/bitcoin-testnet-box`

or build it yourself from this directory
  * `docker build -t bitcoin-testnet-box .`

### Running docker container
The docker image will run two bitcoin nodes in the background and is meant to be
attached to allow you to type in commands. The image also exposes
the two JSON-RPC ports from the nodes if you want to be able to access them
from outside the container.
      
   `$ docker run -t -i -p 19001:19001 -p 19011:19011 nan0desu/bitcoin-testnet-box`

or if you built the docker image yourself:

   `$ docker run -t -i -p 19001:19001 -p 19011:19011 bitcoin-testnet-box`

## Running without docker
To run without docker, one should download the supported Bitcoin core version. 
To find the supported version, search for the `BITCOIN_CORE_VERSION` environment variable
in the `Dockerfile` file.
